# 3GPP NR ns-3 module #

This is an [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") NR module for the
simulation of 3GPP NR non-standalone cellular networks. ns-3 is used as a base
simulator, on top of which can be added our NR module as plug-in.

## ns-3 + NR prerequisites

### ns-3 prerequisites:

Make sure to install all [ns-3 preresquisites](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation#Prerequisites).

### NR prerequisites:

Install libc6-dev (it provides `semaphore.h` header file):

```
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev
```

Install sqlite:

```
apt-get install sqlite sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

Notice that ns-3 and nr prerequisites are required (otherwise you will get an error, e.g: `fatal error: ns3/sqlite-output.h`).

## ns-3 + nr installation

###  Download ns-3:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev.git
cd ns-3-dev
```

### Download the NR module:

```
cd contrib
git clone https://gitlab.com/cttc-lena/nr.git
```

Notice that since these are two independent git repositories, when you run
`git status` inside of the ns-3, you will notice that the contrib/nr
directory will be listed as "Untracked files". This is normal.

### Switch to the latest NR release branch:

Checkout the latest NR release branch (usually the branch with the highest version
number, to list git branches run `git branch -r`). For example, for NR Release v2.2 run:

```
cd nr
git checkout 5g-lena-v2.4.y
```

### Switch to the recommended ns-3 release branch:

Check in the [NR RELEASE_NOTES.md Supported platforms](https://gitlab.com/cttc-lena/nr/-/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md#supported-platforms) which is the recommended ns-3 release, and then check out the corresponding ns-3 release branch.
For example, if the NR RELEASE_NOTES.md indicates that the recommended ns-3 release is ".38" you can run:

```
cd ../..
git checkout ns-3.38
```

For a quicker reference we provide a table with the supported versions of ns-3-dev
for each NR release.

| NR version     | ns-3 version | Build system  |
| :------------: | :-----------:| :-----------: |
| 5g-lena-v2.4.y | ns-3.38      | cmake         |
| 5g-lena-v2.3.y | ns-3.37      | cmake         |
| 5g-lena-v2.2.y | ns-3.36.1    | cmake         |
| 5g-lena-v2.1.y | ns-3.36      | cmake         |
| 5g-lena-v2.0.y | ns-3.36      | cmake         |
| 5g-lena-v1.3.y | ns-3.35      | waf           |


### Test ns-3 + nr installation:

Let's configure the ns-3 + NR project:

```
./ns3 configure --enable-examples --enable-tests
```

In the output you should see: `SQLite support: ON`.

If that is not the case, return to "ns-3 and NR prerequisites" section, and install all prerequisites. After the installation of the missing packages run again `./ns3 configure --enable-tests --enable-examples`.

To compile the ns-3 with NR you can run the following command:

```
./ns3
```

If the NR module is recognized correctly, you should see "nr" in the list of
built modules. If that is the case, _Welcome to the NR world !_

Further instructions on how to run the examples are given in the [Getting Started instructions](https://cttc-lena.gitlab.io/nr/html/getting-started.html).

## Upgrading 5G-LENA

We assume that your work lives in a separate branch, and that the 'master'
branch of the NR repository is left untouched as the first time you downloaded
it. If it is not the case, then please move all your work in a separate branch.

A vanilla 'master' branch can be updated by simply running:

```
cd ns-3-dev/contrib/nr    # or src/nr if the module lives under src/
git checkout master
git pull
```

## Documentation

We maintain two sources of documentation:

1. [The user manual](https://cttc-lena.gitlab.io/nr/nrmodule.pdf) describes the models and their assumptions; as
we developed the module while the 3GPP standard was not fully available, some parts
are not modeling precisely the procedures as indicated by the standard.

2. [The Doxygen](https://cttc-lena.gitlab.io/nr/html/), you will find details about design
and user usage of any class of the module, as well as description and
images for the examples and the tests.



### Building documentation

If you would like to build the documentation on your own, you can follow the
instructions from this section.

- To build the user manual, navigate to the nr folder and then:

```
cd doc
make latexpdf
```

And you will find the PDF user manual in the directory build/latex. Please note
that you may have to install some requirements to build the documentation; you
can find the list of packages for any Ubuntu-based distribution in the file
`.gitlab-ci.yml`.

- To build the doxygen documentation, please do from the nr folder:

```
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive
python3 doc/m.css/documentation/doxygen.py doc/doxygen-mcss.conf --debug
```

You will find the doxygen documentation inside `doc/doc/html/`.
Please note that you may need to initialize the m.css submodule, and
to install some packages like python3.

## Contributions are welcome!

As you may know, to fund, design, develop and then maintain an
open source software for a novel communication technology is a
challenging and time expensive task. For this, we would like to
foster collaborations with researchers and companies around the globe:

- If you identify a bug, please let us know through the Gitlab issue page;
- If you have a development plan that you can share, please get in touch with us.
We may be able to provide useful suggestions with your design and then maybe your
contribution can be more integrated more efficiently and be useful to let the project grow;
- If you plan to share your code, as the GPLv2 permits, please help us to
integrate it so that the work you have done does not become outdated
and then impossible to merge;
- The more we are, the better we can do!
