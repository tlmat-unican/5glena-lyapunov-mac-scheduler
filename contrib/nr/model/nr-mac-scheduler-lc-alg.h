/**
 * \ingroup scheduler
 *
 * \brief This class is the interface for the creation of various scheduling
 * algorithms for the distribution of the assigned bytes to the different LCGs/LCs
 * of a UE.
 *
 * Notice that in the past, the AssignBytesToLC was a method of NrMacSchedulerNs3.
 * This however, did not allow other algorithms to be used for the byte distribution.
 * For this, we have moved it to a class and defined the NrMacSchedulerLcRR
 * as the default type so that the default distribution will be done in a Round Robin
 * manner. Other algorithms can be included by implementing additional classes.
 *
 * Moreover, we have separated the function call into DL and UL direction, due to the
 * scheduler limitation to distinguish among the various LCs of an LCG (it considers
 * only the first LC of an LCG). This way we can allow more sophisticated algorithms
 * to be applied in the DL direction, while the UL can be kept simpler.
