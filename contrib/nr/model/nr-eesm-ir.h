/**
 * \ingroup error-models
 * \brief Eesm error model, based on the IR HARQ
 *
 * In HARQ-IR, every retransmission contains different coded bits than the previous
 * one. The different retransmissions typically use a different set of coding bits.
 * Therefore, both the effective SINR and the equivalent ECR need to be recomputed
 * after each retransmission.
 *
 * In HARQ-IR, the HARQ history contains the last computed effective SINR and
 * number of coded bits of each of the previous retransmissions. Given the current
 * SINR vector and the HARQ history, the effective SINR is computed according to EESM.
 *
 * NOTE: The method GetMcsEq() must be called after ComputeSINR(), as it uses
 * the value m_Reff.
 *
 * Please, don't use this class directly, but one between NrEesmIrT1 or NrEesmIrT2,
 * depending on what table you want to use.
