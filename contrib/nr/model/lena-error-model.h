/**
 * \ingroup error-models
 * \brief LENA error model
 *
 * LENA is calculating the transport block sizes in a different way than we
 * employ in our module. In particular, it uses tables that come from the standard.
 * This error model is created to have the same values as used in LENA.
 *
 * Please note that, since LENA always assigns all the available symbols to the
 * UE, the transport block calculation is way more limited than in NR. To account
 * for symbol granularity, in NR we are calling the function GetPayloadSize()
 * by passing the number of RB in frequency, multiplied by the number of symbols
 * assigned. To avoid a costly API rewrite through the NR module, we assume that
 * the code that will be calling this function (hopefully, and OFDMA scheduler)
 * will assign all the symbols except the *single* DL or UL CTRL symbol.
 *
 * For matching the two RB values, we divide by 13 (hence, assuming 1 CTRL symbol)
 * the value of RB that is coming as input. As example, imagine that the scheduler
 * is assigning 2 RB over 13 symbols. In LENA, the function GetPayloadSize()
 * would have been called with the input parameter RB set to 2; in NR, we call
 * it with the same input parameter set to 26. To be able to retrieve the
 * same value from the table, we have to adapt it, and here is explained why
 * we divide by 13 the RB number.
 *
 * Please note that we assume 1 symbol for CTRL. If you use more than one,
 * then the calculation will be wrong.
