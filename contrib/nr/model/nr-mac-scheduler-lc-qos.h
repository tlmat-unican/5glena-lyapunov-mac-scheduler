     *        guaranteed bitrate information of an LC.
     *        In particular, the operation is divided in 4 parts:
     *        1. The first part creates two lists, one with the GBR/DC-GBR active LCs that
     *        have their ERAB guaranteed bit rate requirements set and one with all the
     *        active LCs.
     *        2. In case there more than 1 GBR/DC-GBR active LCs that have their ERAB
     *        guaranteed bit rate requirements set, and their total requirements exceed the
     *        assigned bytes (tbs), then the algorithm assigns equally all the assigned
     *        bytes in RR fashion to these GBR/DC-GBR LCs.
     *        3. In case their total requirements are less than the assigned bytes, the
     *        algorithm assigns to each LC the minimum among the ERAB guaranteed bit rate
     *        and the RLC buffer size.
     *        4. The rest of the bytes, if any, are assigned in the rest of the LCs in RR
     *        fashion.
